# Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera Project) 
The purpose of this repository is to host the files for the Coursera course project:

* Getting and Cleaning data

It includes the the CodeBook.md file which describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data. It also includes the R script, run_analysis.R, which performs the computations as well as the output file called tidy_data.txt which was requested in the final step of the assignment.
